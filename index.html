Laura spent her early years in the small town of Fremont in western New York surrounded by farmland.  She stayed fairly local for college and Veterinary school.  After spending a couple of summers working with the NIH in Montana, she fell in love with the west and headed out to Oregon following graduation.  Starting out in mixed animal practice working mostly with alpacas, Laura eventually found her way to emergency medicine.  She returned briefly to the East before meeting her better half.  While she is sad to be so far away from family, including her newest niece (pictured above), she is excited to experience life in the middle of the country.</p>

                            <p>In 2010 the two were both wild and running free around San Francisco’s Marina District, as most singles do. Bradley was quite the bachelor- planning weekend getaways with friends, float trips, and taking last minute trips to Ibiza, Cabo, wherever the wind blew. Sarah was quite the bachelorette, wining and dining around San Francisco, on a strict agenda which included over-extending herself, saying yes to every social engagement that came her way.  After a mutual friend of the two suggested they would make a cute couple, a date was on the books and they began to discover just how compatible they were. In no time, they also discovered they were inseparable and very in love. The rest is history- they’ve shared some amazing adventures around the world, each other's toothbrushes, and now they’re ready to share the rest of their lives together, too.</p>

                            <h2>THE ENGAGEMENT</h2>
                            <p>Down in San Diego for a weekend to visit Bradley’s mom, the pair decided to spend the beautiful morning at Balboa Park. After returning to their hotel, Bradley asked Sarah to run up to their room for a bottle of wine that had been chilling. Bradley said he was going to ask concierge for a “wine opener” and that he’d meet her in the courtyard. As Sarah opened the door to the room, she “freaked out”, thinking she was in the wrong room. It was decorated with bouquets of her favorite flowers, decadent treats and champagne. Rose petals on the floor led her to the open balcony, and as she walked out she saw Bradley waiting for her down below, with a huge grin on his face. And like out of a fairy tale, Romeo asked Juliet to be his wife. She giggled, and said yes. Bradley had it all captured by a hidden, sniper-style photographer.</p>

                                Pigrim Chapel had its beginnings as Pilgrim Lutheran Church for the Deaf, a congregation for the deaf and hard of hearing. The stone building that housed the congregation, often referred to as the "Church of Silence," was constructed in 1941. Pilgrim Chapel is a rare example of a religious building constructed by and for a special needs membership. As a result of the unique architecture and special focus, Pilgrim Chapel and the parsonage next door were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pilgrim Lutheran Church for the Deaf closed in 1987. Russell and Della Millin purchased the building and maintained it as a facility for community and religious activities. In 1997, under the leadership of Roger and Elizabeth Coleman, the facility was acquired from the Millin’s and a not-for profit organization was created to oversee the chapel’s use and restoration. Today, Pilgrim Chapel retains its original charm and serves as a public facility open to people of all faiths.

                                The historic Loose Mansion was originally built by Jacob and Ella Loose between 1907 and 1909 at a cost of $250,000.  The architect was well known for building embassies in Washington, D.C.  Although the mansion was a private home, it was designed for entertaining large groups and constructed to be extremely solid with cement flooring.  The mansion had 11 fireplaces, 12 bathrooms and 8 balconies.  The mansion’s Carriage House was home to three of the mansion’s full-time staff and Jacob’s 1907 Packard Limousine.  Bedrooms for two more full-time staff were provided on the 3rd level next to the mansion's original Ballroom.

                                Although Jacob Loose made his fortune in the cookie and candy business, the money to build Loose Mansion actually came from another source.  Jacob and his brother, Joseph, each gave $10,000 to a friend who subsequently discovered copper in the Northwest.  Their investment paid off ... $1,000,000 each!

                                Jacob told his wife, Ella, he wanted to give her anything she wanted with some of the proceeds from his windfall investment.  She told him she wanted to return to Kansas City (from their current home in Chicago) and build a beautiful home in which they could entertain ... and that they did!

                                Just as the architecture of the missions tells a story about the history of California, so does Lilian Rice’s legendary design of The Inn. It is a perfect representation of old California charm and Rice's belief that true beauty lies in simplicity rather than ornateness. The Inn is a perfect reflection of Rice's dream - a place where time stands still amidst the simplistic, natural beauty that is Rancho Santa Fe.  &nbsp;&nbsp;
