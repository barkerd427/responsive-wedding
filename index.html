Laura spent her early years in the small town of Fremont in western New York surrounded by farmland.  She stayed fairly local for college and Veterinary school.  After spending a couple of summers working with the NIH in Montana, she fell in love with the west and headed out to Oregon following graduation.  Starting out in mixed animal practice working mostly with alpacas, Laura eventually found her way to emergency medicine.  She returned briefly to the East before meeting her better half.  While she is sad to be so far away from family, including her newest niece (pictured above), she is excited to experience life in the middle of the country.</p>

                                Pigrim Chapel had its beginnings as Pilgrim Lutheran Church for the Deaf, a congregation for the deaf and hard of hearing. The stone building that housed the congregation, often referred to as the "Church of Silence," was constructed in 1941. Pilgrim Chapel is a rare example of a religious building constructed by and for a special needs membership. As a result of the unique architecture and special focus, Pilgrim Chapel and the parsonage next door were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pilgrim Lutheran Church for the Deaf closed in 1987. Russell and Della Millin purchased the building and maintained it as a facility for community and religious activities. In 1997, under the leadership of Roger and Elizabeth Coleman, the facility was acquired from the Millin’s and a not-for profit organization was created to oversee the chapel’s use and restoration. Today, Pilgrim Chapel retains its original charm and serves as a public facility open to people of all faiths.

                            <h2>HISTORY OF THE MANSION</h2>
                            <p>
                                <img src="img/themansion.jpg" class="themansion" alt="Loose Mansion" />
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The historic Loose Mansion was originally built by Jacob and Ella Loose between 1907 and 1909 at a cost of $250,000.  The architect was well known for building embassies in Washington, D.C.  Although the mansion was a private home, it was designed for entertaining large groups and constructed to be extremely solid with cement flooring.  The mansion had 11 fireplaces, 12 bathrooms and 8 balconies.  The mansion’s Carriage House was home to three of the mansion’s full-time staff and Jacob’s 1907 Packard Limousine.  Bedrooms for two more full-time staff were provided on the 3rd level next to the mansion's original Ballroom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although Jacob Loose made his fortune in the cookie and candy business, the money to build Loose Mansion actually came from another source.  Jacob and his brother, Joseph, each gave $10,000 to a friend who subsequently discovered copper in the Northwest.  Their investment paid off ... $1,000,000 each!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jacob told his wife, Ella, he wanted to give her anything she wanted with some of the proceeds from his windfall investment.  She told him she wanted to return to Kansas City (from their current home in Chicago) and build a beautiful home in which they could entertain ... and that they did!
